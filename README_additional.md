## PHP Prerequisites

 We recommend that before you try to run server.py, you verify that the binaries in /server/php can actually be run in your machine. If not, you should download the php binaries yourself and completeley replace the /php folder with the ones you downloaded.

 We have tested this app ONLY on windows with windows binaries, so we cannot guarantee that this app will run on any other OS without very specific tweaks.

 After downloading the php binaries, you should also copy php.ini from the /server folder to the /server/php subdirectory.
